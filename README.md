# IoT-based-greenhouse-monitoring-system-using-cisco-packet-tracer

Greenhouses have to be monitored manually whereas by making it a smart greenhouse that is by
using IoT technique it can be monitored from faraway places also. Different sensors as per the
requirement are used to monitor greenhouse and perform the actions according to the parameters
sensed. The conditions are predefined by the maintainer so that the growth of the plant is not
affected by environmental conditions.

The components used in the IOT Based Greenhouse Environment Monitoring and Controlling
systems are
● Temperature Sensor
● Light Sensor
● Humidity Sensor
● Soil Moisture Sensor
● Fire sensor
● Lawn Sprinkler
● CO2 detector
● water level monitor
● Smart door system


The objectives of the project are:
1) To develop a remote controlling and monitoring system for greenhouse applications.
2) To understand the working principle of typical greenhouse control system and its main
parameters.
3) To provide an effective solution to the existence problem related to the greenhouse
control system technology by applying tools and techniques of problem solving.
